Introducing a decentralized, rewards-based platform fundraising non profits over user engagement

Problem:

Based on the fact that the current online advertising model no longer fits users (ex: Increase of Adblockers, Fraudulent traffic,malvertisements and privacy violations). We've changed the rules by offering a new and fair model to users, where each one of their user engagement and interaction with brand or ad turns into a donation to Non-Profit Organizations.

Realising the only powers users has today is either blocking ads either skipping ads, we've created a new power the power to Engage For Impact the power to Watch And Give.


Solution:

The solution is a decentralized, rewards-based platform fundraising non profits over user engagement

To do so, we created 3 different ways to reach engaged for Impact Audience:

- A smart widget for publishers that can be integrated into any websites, where user can interact with advertising to generate tokens for Non Profits.

- An on-demand customisable chatbot for Facebook Pages where users can help Non Profits just by chatting on Facebook

- An Augmented reality scan to intercat with brands and generating donations for Non-Profit

The link between those 3 channels is the EFI Token (Engage For Impact Token) that will transit between the 3 key Players (Brands, Users, NonProfits)
The process will be the following:

1/ We issue a utility token called EFI that will be bought by brands on our platform in order to spread their ads with Social Impact.

2/ Users will earn tokens every time they will interact with ads, those tokens will be designed to be sent to their favorite Non Profits Organization

3/ Non Profits will receive tokens from users that can be exchange at anytime into any currencies or sold to advertisers. 

EFI is designed to tokenize User Engagement for Social Impact, its a payment system for brands to be finally seen with attention, a new way of making donations for users, and a new source of ad revenue for Non Profits.
